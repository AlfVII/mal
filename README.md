Magnetic Agnostic Structure (MAS) is a project providing a common language for defining any kind of magnetic for Power Electronics, independently of its function (transformer, inductor, choke, etc.), construction (number of winding, planar or wound technology, materials used, etc.), application (power conversiob, filtering, etc.) , or manufacturer.
This is accomplished with a series of JSON schemas that provide rules for defining any magnetic.
